## Abstract

Companies running dozens of A/B experiments simultaneously waste significant time waiting 2-4 weeks per test for statistical significance. This project demonstrates how machine learning can predict experiment outcomes at **day 5** with **91% accuracy**, reducing time-to-decision by **64%** compared to traditional significance testing.

The system simulates 1,200 realistic A/B experiments, engineers 20+ statistical and Bayesian features from partial data, and trains classification models to predict whether the treatment will win, lose, or be inconclusive  -  days before a classical z-test would reach significance.

## Key Results

| Checkpoint | ML Accuracy | ML F1 Score | Z-Test Resolved | Days Saved |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Day 1 | 74.3% | 0.735 | ~8% | 13 days |
| Day 3 | 87.4% | 0.870 | ~28% | 11 days |
| **Day 5** | **90.7%** | **0.905** | ~42% | **9 days** |
| Day 7 | 94.0% | 0.940 | ~55% | 7 days |

> For a team running 50 experiments per quarter, predicting winners at day 5 saves **~450 experiment-days per quarter**.

## Business Problem

A/B testing is the gold standard for product decisions. But classical hypothesis testing has a limitation: it forces teams to wait until a pre-determined sample size is reached, even when the outcome is already apparent.

**This project asks:** Can ML predict the final experiment outcome using only partial data (days 1-7), without sacrificing decision quality?

### Approach

1. **Simulate** 1,200 experiments with realistic effect distributions (40% positive, 30% negative, 30% null)
2. **Engineer features** from partial data: statistical evidence (z-stat, p-value), Bayesian posteriors, conversion trends, sample size metrics
3. **Train models** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) with experiment-level splitting to prevent data leakage
4. **Compare** ML predictions at days 1, 3, 5, 7 against the traditional z-test resolution rate
5. **Explain** predictions using SHAP values and feature importance

## Dataset Design

Each of the 1,200 simulated experiments includes:

| Feature | Description |
|-|-|
| `experiment_id` | Unique experiment identifier |
| `day_number` | Day 1-14 (daily snapshots) |
| `visitors_control/treatment` | Cumulative visitors per arm |
| `conversions_control/treatment` | Cumulative conversions per arm |
| `conversion_rate_control/treatment` | Running conversion rates |
| `observed_lift` | Treatment CR − Control CR |
| `device_type`, `region`, `traffic_source` | Experiment metadata |
| `segment`, `experiment_category` | User and experiment context |
| `baseline_conversion_rate` | Pre-experiment baseline |
| `sample_size_progress` | % of expected traffic collected |

**Target variable:** `final_outcome`  -  determined by a two-proportion z-test on full day-14 data:
- `treatment_wins` (p < 0.05, positive lift)
- `control_wins` (p < 0.05, negative lift)
- `inconclusive` (p >= 0.05)

-

## Engineered Features

| Category | Features | Purpose |
|-|-|-|
| Conversion | cumulative_lift, relative_uplift, gap_trend, rolling CRs | Direct treatment signal |
| Statistical | z_statistic, p_value, SE, lift/SE ratio | Evidence strength |
| Bayesian | P(treatment wins), expected lift, CI width | Probabilistic assessment |
| Sample Size | total_visitors, progress, balance ratio | Data sufficiency |
| Metadata | device, region, traffic source, category (one-hot) | Experiment context |

## Feature Importance

![Feature Importance](visuals/feature_importance_day5.png)

**Top predictors at Day 5:**
1. `z_statistic`  -  statistical evidence strength
2. `bayesian_prob_treatment_wins`  -  Bayesian probability of treatment winning
3. `lift_to_se_ratio`  -  signal-to-noise ratio
4. `cumulative_lift`  -  raw conversion rate difference
5. `sample_size_progress`  -  data collection completeness

-

## Data Leakage Prevention

> Critical design decision: The train-test split is by **experiment_id**, not by rows.

Each experiment has 14 daily rows. Random row-level splitting would leak future information about the same experiment into training. All 14 rows for a given experiment stay in the same split (train or test).

## Limitations & Edge Case Handling

- Dataset is simulated with controlled parameters; real-world noise patterns may differ
- Model should be retrained periodically on historical experiments in production
- Results represent a proof-of-concept framework, not a deployed production system
- Novelty effects and long-term behavioral changes are not captured in simulation
- The pipeline validates required columns and handles missing data gracefully (zero-visitor arms, missing outcome labels, absent features) with explicit warnings rather than silent failures

-

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates that ML can reliably predict A/B test outcomes 9 days earlier than traditional statistical testing, with 91% accuracy at day 5. The approach combines statistical evidence (z-statistics), Bayesian probability, and conversion trend features to identify likely winners before classical significance is reached.

**When to use this approach:**
- Teams running many concurrent experiments
- Experiments with clear positive or negative effects
- Decision support (flagging likely outcomes for review)

**When to keep traditional testing:**
- High-stakes experiments (pricing, core UX)
- Edge cases with very small expected effects
- Regulatory or compliance requirements
